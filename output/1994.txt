The top 1 teams from each division go to the postseason, plus 1 wild cards.
The AL has 162 games per team.
The NL has 162 games per team.
The ALC has more contenders at the end of the season than I expected: {'KCA', 'CLE', 'MIL', 'MIN', 'CHA'}. This discrepancy is either because I still handle ties incorrectly, or it was an actual tie and they held a playoff later on.
The ALE has more contenders at the end of the season than I expected: {'DET', 'BAL', 'TOR', 'BOS', 'NYA'}. This discrepancy is either because I still handle ties incorrectly, or it was an actual tie and they held a playoff later on.

The NLE has more contenders at the end of the season than I expected: {'MON', 'PHI', 'NYN', 'ATL', 'FLO'}. This discrepancy is either because I still handle ties incorrectly, or it was an actual tie and they held a playoff later on.
