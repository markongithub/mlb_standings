This season has 16 teams.
The top 1 teams from each division go to the postseason, plus 0 wild cards.
The AA has 140 games per team.
The NL has 140 games per team.
The NL has more contenders at the end of the season than I expected: {'BSN', 'CHN'}. This discrepancy is either because I still handle ties incorrectly, or it was an actual tie and they held a playoff later on.
