This season has 26 teams.
The top 1 teams from each division go to the postseason, plus 1981 was weird sorry wild cards.
The AL has 162 games per team.
The NL has 162 games per team.
The ALE has more contenders at the end of the season than I expected: {'MIL', 'BOS', 'NYA', 'BAL', 'CLE', 'DET', 'TOR'}. This discrepancy is either because I still handle ties incorrectly, or it was an actual tie and they held a playoff later on.
The ALW has more contenders at the end of the season than I expected: {'TEX', 'CHA', 'OAK', 'KCA', 'CAL', 'MIN', 'SEA'}. This discrepancy is either because I still handle ties incorrectly, or it was an actual tie and they held a playoff later on.
The NLE has more contenders at the end of the season than I expected: {'PIT', 'SLN', 'CHN', 'NYN', 'MON', 'PHI'}. This discrepancy is either because I still handle ties incorrectly, or it was an actual tie and they held a playoff later on.
The NLW has more contenders at the end of the season than I expected: {'SDN', 'LAN', 'SFN', 'ATL', 'HOU', 'CIN'}. This discrepancy is either because I still handle ties incorrectly, or it was an actual tie and they held a playoff later on.
