There were ties for the division slots but all of those tied teams ended up wild cards so it didn't really matter. I haven't figured out how to handle those situations yet. Sorry!
This season has 30 teams.
The top 2 teams from each division go to the postseason, plus 2 wild cards.
The AL has 60 games per team.
The NL has 60 games per team.
Starting analysis of 20200927
The ALC has more contenders at the end of the season than I expected: ['CHA', 'CLE', 'MIN']. This discrepancy is either because I still handle ties incorrectly, or it was an actual tie and they held a playoff later on.
The NLC has more contenders at the end of the season than I expected: ['CHN', 'CIN', 'SLN']. This discrepancy is either because I still handle ties incorrectly, or it was an actual tie and they held a playoff later on.
The NL has more wild card contenders (who are not leading their divisions) at the end of the season than I expected: ['CIN', 'MIL', 'SFN']. This discrepancy is either because my analysis is wrong, or it was an actual tie and they held a playoff later on.
