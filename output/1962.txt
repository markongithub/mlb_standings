This season has 20 teams.
The top 1 teams from each division go to the postseason, plus 0 wild cards.
The AL has 162 games per team.
The NL has 162 games per team.
The NL has more contenders at the end of the season than I expected: ['LAN', 'SFN']. This discrepancy is either because I still handle ties incorrectly, or it was an actual tie and they held a playoff later on.
