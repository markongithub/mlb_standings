This season has 24 teams.
The top 1 teams from each division go to the postseason, plus 0 wild cards.
The AL has 154 games per team.
The FL has 154 games per team.
The NL has 154 games per team.
The FL has more contenders at the end of the season than I expected: ['BLF', 'CHF', 'IND']. This discrepancy is either because I still handle ties incorrectly, or it was an actual tie and they held a playoff later on.
