This season has 30 teams.
The top 1 teams from each division go to the postseason, plus 2 wild cards.
The AL has 162 games per team.
The NL has 162 games per team.
Starting analysis of 20130929
The AL has more wild card contenders (who are not leading their divisions) at the end of the season than I expected: ['CLE', 'TBA', 'TEX']. This discrepancy is either because my analysis is wrong, or it was an actual tie and they held a playoff later on.
