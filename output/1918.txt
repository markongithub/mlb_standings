This season has 16 teams.
The top 1 teams from each division go to the postseason, plus 0 wild cards.
The AL has 154 games per team.
The NL has 154 games per team.
... but for this season we are not assuming they play them all.
The AL has more contenders at the end of the season than I expected: ['BOS', 'CHA', 'CLE', 'DET', 'NYA', 'PHA', 'SLA', 'WS1']. This discrepancy is either because I still handle ties incorrectly, or it was an actual tie and they held a playoff later on.
The NL has more contenders at the end of the season than I expected: ['CHN', 'CIN', 'NY1', 'PIT']. This discrepancy is either because I still handle ties incorrectly, or it was an actual tie and they held a playoff later on.
The Philadelphia Phillies were eliminated from the NL title on 19180902 with 28 games left to play.
The Brooklyn Robins were eliminated from the NL title on 19180901 with 28 games left to play.
The Boston Braves were eliminated from the NL title on 19180830 with 32 games left to play.
The St. Louis Cardinals were eliminated from the NL title on 19180826 with 29 games left to play.
